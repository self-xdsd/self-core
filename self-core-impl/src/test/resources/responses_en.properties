hello.comment=Hi @%s! I'm the Project Manager of this project. I take care of Issues' assignments, payments and more. \
              Want me to work for your project too? Go [here](https://self-xdsd.com). \n\n\
              I work primarily at Github, but I'll also start working at GitLab and BitBucket soon.
newIssue.comment=@%s thank you for reporting this. I'll assign someone to take care of it soon.
newIssueUnassigned.comment=@%s thank you for reporting this. Unfortunately, @%s is not a contributor \
                           with the required role (%s), that's why I unassigned them. \n\n\
                           I will assign a contributor to take care of it soon.
newPullRequest.comment=@%s thank you for your Pull Request. I'll assign someone to review it soon. \n\n \
                       If this PR solves a ``todo`` from the code, please don't forget to remove it.
reopened.comment=@%s thanks for reopening this, I'll find someone to take a look at it. \n\
                 However, please keep in mind that reopening tickets is a bad practice. Next time, please \
                 open a new ticket.
reopenedPullRequest.comment=@%s thanks for reopening this PR, I'll find someone to review it soon.
noAssigneeFound.comment=@%s I couldn't find any assignee for this task. This is either because there are \
                        no contributors with role ``%s`` available or because the project does not have enough funds.\n\n\
                        Please, make sure there is at least one available contributor with the required role and \
                        the project can afford to pay them.
taskAssigned.comment=@%s this is your task now, please go ahead. Deadline (when this ticket should be closed) \
                     is ``%s``.\n\n\
                     Estimation here is ``%s minutes``, that's how much you will be paid.\n\n\
                     Remember, you don't have to solve everything in this ticket - you can solve it [partially](https://docs.self-xdsd.com/microtasking.html) \
                     and leave ``todo`` markers in the code, which will become future tasks.\n\n\
                     If you have any questions don't ask me, I'm not a technical person. Open new tickets instead.\n\n\
                     If you don't have time or simply don't want to work on this, you can always [resign](https://docs.self-xdsd.com/projectmanager.html#commands).
pullRequestAssigned.comment=@%s please review this Pull Request. Deadline (when it should be merged or closed) \
                            is ``%s``.\n\n\
                            You should check if the requirements have been implemented (partially or in full), \
                            if there are unit tests covering the changes and if the CI build passes. \
                            Feel free to reject the PR or ask for changes if it's too big or not clear enough.\n\n\
                            Estimation here is ``%s minutes``, that's how much you will be paid. You will be \
                            paid even if this PR gets rejected.

                     Only the task's assignee can ask for resignation.
